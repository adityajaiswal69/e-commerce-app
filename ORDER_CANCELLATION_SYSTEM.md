## 🧪 Testing Guide

### 1. Database Setup
```sql
-- Run the schema file
\i sql/schema/025_cancellation_requests.sql
```

### 2. Customer Testing
1. **Place an Order** → Complete a test order through checkout
2. **View Order Details** → Navigate to `/orders` and click on an order
3. **Test Cancel Button** → Verify button appears for eligible orders
4. **Submit Cancellation** → Test the modal with different reasons
5. **Check Status** → Verify request appears on order details

### 3. Admin Testing
1. **Access Admin Panel** → Navigate to `/admin/cancellation-requests`
2. **View Requests** → Verify requests appear in the list
3. **Filter Functionality** → Test status filters (All/Pending/Approved/Rejected)
4. **Process Request** → Click "Process" and test approve/reject
5. **Refund Settings** → Test refund amount for paid orders

### 4. Email Testing
1. **Check Console** → Email content is logged to console (placeholder implementation)
2. **Notification Records** → Verify records are created in `cancellation_notifications`
3. **Status Updates** → Test that email status is updated correctly

## 🔧 Configuration

### Cancellation Reasons
Default reasons are automatically inserted:
1. **Delivery Delay** - "The delivery is taking longer than expected"
2. **No Longer Needed** - "I no longer need the product"
3. **Change of Mind** - "I changed my mind about the purchase"
4. **Purchased Elsewhere** - "I have already bought the product from another source due to urgency"
5. **Time-Sensitive Requirement** - "The product was for a specific occasion, which has now passed"
6. **Wrong Item** - "Ordered wrong item/size/color"
7. **Financial Reasons** - "Financial constraints"
8. **Duplicate Order** - "Accidentally placed duplicate order"
9. **Quality Concerns** - "Concerns about product quality"
10. **Other** - "Other reason (please specify)"

### Order Eligibility
Orders can be cancelled when:
- Status is `pending`, `confirmed`, or `processing`
- No existing cancellation request exists
- Payment status is not `refunded`

### Email Integration
Currently uses placeholder implementation. To integrate with real email service:
1. Update `lib/email/cancellation-notifications.ts`
2. Replace `sendCancellationEmail` function with actual email service
3. Configure email service credentials

## 🚀 Deployment Notes

### Environment Variables
No additional environment variables required for basic functionality.

### Database Migrations
Run the schema file to create required tables and triggers.

### Email Service
Integrate with your preferred email service (SendGrid, AWS SES, etc.) by updating the email notification functions.

## 🔒 Security Features

- ✅ **Row Level Security** - Users can only see their own cancellation requests
- ✅ **Admin Authorization** - Only admins can process cancellation requests
- ✅ **Input Validation** - All inputs are validated and sanitized
- ✅ **Audit Trail** - All actions are logged with timestamps and user IDs

## 📊 Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Track
- Number of cancellation requests per day/week
- Approval vs rejection rates
- Most common cancellation reasons
- Average processing time
- Refund amounts and processing status

### Database Queries for Analytics
```sql
-- Cancellation request statistics
SELECT 
  status,
  COUNT(*) as count,
  AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (processed_at - created_at))/3600) as avg_processing_hours
FROM cancellation_requests 
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY status;

-- Most common cancellation reasons
SELECT 
  reason,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM cancellation_requests 
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY reason 
ORDER BY count DESC;
```

## 🎉 Success Criteria

The order cancellation system is now fully functional with:
- ✅ Customer-facing order details and cancellation request functionality
- ✅ Admin dashboard for managing cancellation requests
- ✅ Database schema with proper security and constraints
- ✅ Email notification system (ready for integration)
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling and validation
- ✅ Mobile-responsive design
